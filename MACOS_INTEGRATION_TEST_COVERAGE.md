### 7. Path Handling (`TestMacOSIntegrationPathHandling`)
Tests platform-specific path handling edge cases:
- Paths with spaces
- Unicode characters in paths
- Deeply nested directory structures
- Special character handling

### 8. TCC Permission Handling (`TestMacOSIntegrationTCCPermissionHandling`)
Tests macOS privacy permission configurations:
- Camera and microphone access
- Location services
- Contacts and calendar access
- Photos library access
- Verifies entitlements are properly configured without triggering actual prompts

### 9. Bundle Cleanup (`TestMacOSIntegrationBundleCleanup`)
Tests temporary bundle cleanup logic:
- Temporary bundle creation in system temp directories
- Cleanup scheduling for go-build executables
- KeepTemp flag behavior

### 10. Complete Workflow Integration (`TestMacOSIntegrationCompleteWorkflow`)
End-to-end integration test covering:
- Bundle structure creation
- Info.plist content with custom entries
- Entitlements.plist generation
- Executable permissions
- Bundle reuse behavior
- Full application configuration

### 11. Bundle Icon Handling (`TestMacOSIntegrationBundleIconHandling`)
Tests default icon integration:
- Default ExecutableBinaryIcon.icns copying
- Resources directory creation
- Graceful handling when system icon unavailable

### 12. Xcode Environment (`TestMacOSIntegrationXcodeEnvironment`)
Tests developer environment detection:
- Xcode installation detection
- Code signing identity availability
- Developer tools environment checking
- Command line tools detection

### 13. Error Recovery (`TestMacOSIntegrationErrorRecovery`)
Tests error handling and recovery scenarios:
- Non-existent executable handling
- Invalid bundle path permissions
- Corrupted bundle detection
- Graceful error reporting

### 14. Concurrent Bundle Creation (`TestMacOSIntegrationConcurrentBundleCreation`)
Tests thread safety and concurrent operations:
- Multiple simultaneous bundle creations
- Independent configuration handling
- Race condition prevention
- Parallel bundle structure verification

### 15. Context-Based Operations (`TestMacOSIntegrationBundleWithContext`)
Tests context handling for cancellable operations:
- Pipe creation with context
- I/O operations with timeouts
- Context cancellation handling
- Resource cleanup on cancellation

## Key Integration Scenarios Tested

### Platform-Specific Integration Points
1. **Bundle Structure**: Complete .app bundle hierarchy validation
2. **Plist Files**: Info.plist and entitlements.plist generation and formatting
3. **Code Signing**: Integration with macOS codesign tool
4. **File Permissions**: Executable bit preservation and setting
5. **System Paths**: Integration with system icon resources

### Cross-Component Integration
1. **Config → Bundle**: Configuration properly reflected in bundle structure
2. **Entitlements → Plist**: Entitlement requests properly formatted in plists
3. **Executable → Bundle**: Binary copying and permission preservation
4. **Environment → Config**: Environment variables affecting configuration

### Edge Cases Covered
1. **Missing GOPATH**: Falls back to ~/go/bin
2. **Corrupted Bundles**: Proper error handling
3. **Unicode Paths**: Full Unicode support in paths
4. **Concurrent Access**: Thread-safe bundle operations
5. **Permission Errors**: Graceful handling of filesystem errors

## Platform-Specific Issues Discovered

### 1. Plist Generation Limitations
- The `writePlist` function doesn't escape XML special characters
- Arrays and nested structures are converted to string representations
- Recommendation: Consider using proper plist encoding library for complex structures

### 2. Bundle Recovery
- When a file exists where bundle directory should be, mkdir fails
- The current implementation doesn't pre-check for file vs directory conflicts
- Recommendation: Add pre-validation to remove conflicting files

### 3. Code Signing Environment
- Ad-hoc signing may fail in restricted environments
- Tests handle this gracefully with informative logging
- Recommendation: Document code signing requirements clearly

## Safe macOS Testing Practices

### 1. TCC Permission Testing
- Tests verify entitlement configuration without triggering actual permission prompts
- Uses plist validation instead of runtime permission checks
- Prevents test interference with user's system permissions

### 2. Temporary Resource Management
- All test bundles created in temp directories
- Proper cleanup with defer statements
- No permanent modifications to user's system

### 3. Environment Isolation
- Original configurations saved and restored
- Environment variables properly managed
- No global state modifications

### 4. Concurrent Testing Safety
- Each test uses unique bundle names
- Independent configuration instances
- No shared mutable state

### 5. Platform Detection
- All tests check `runtime.GOOS == "darwin"`
- Skip gracefully on non-macOS platforms
- Clear skip messages for CI environments

## Test Execution

To run all macOS integration tests:
```bash
go test -v -run "TestMacOSIntegration" ./macos_integration_test.go ./bundle.go ./api.go ./macgo.go ./signalforwarder.go ./improvedsignals.go
```

To run specific integration test:
```bash
go test -v -run "TestMacOSIntegrationAppBundleCreation" ./macos_integration_test.go ./bundle.go ./api.go ./macgo.go ./signalforwarder.go ./improvedsignals.go
```

## Coverage Improvements

This integration test suite significantly improves coverage for:
- ✅ Complete app bundle creation workflow

## Recommendations for Further Testing

1. **Performance Testing**: Add benchmarks for bundle creation with large executables
2. **Template Testing**: Test embedded template functionality when fs.FS is used
3. **Signal Integration**: Test signal forwarding in bundled applications
4. **Relaunch Testing**: Test the actual relaunch mechanism (requires special test harness)
5. **Security Testing**: Validate sandbox restrictions are properly enforced

## Conclusion

The implemented integration tests provide comprehensive coverage of macOS platform-specific functionality in macgo. They test the complete workflow from configuration to bundle creation, validate all major integration points, handle edge cases gracefully, and follow safe testing practices that don't interfere with the user's system. The tests are designed to run reliably in CI environments while providing thorough validation of platform-specific behavior.
